### v1.2.2 - (<small><i>The fix of the fixes of the major...</i></small>)
<b>UPDATED</b>
* TargetPortal updated to v1.1.17
<b>REMOVED (until updated/fixed)</b>
* Guilds
* Groups

### v1.2.1 - (<small><i>The major update fix (temporary I hope)</i></small>)
<b>REMOVED (until updated/fixed)</b>
* CreatureAndLootControl
* Monstrum
* MonstrumAshlands
* MonstrumDeepNorth

<b>SERVER & MODPACK</p>
* It seems like the update changed quite much. It changed monsters/animals behaviors a bit, it switched out the engine for a newer version and a lot more. This sadly made some mods crash. The ones that broke the game have been removed. There is still some errors in the logfiles but atleast it seem to work now.
* The server have had the mods removed as well and been tested. Some small error in a cfg-file can make it fail to let you connect the first time, but second time you should be fine.
* Both modpack and server will have mods added again when they've been updated. :)

#### Since there isn't a good place to comment or anything on thunderstore (what I've seen) I will add in the wiki-part if there is something going on with the server. So if the server is down or something, check there. I might be working on it and needed a restart.

#### If anything is wrong with the modpack or server, please follow the link on the modpage and just make an issue in github so I know :)

<b>SERVER</b>

<details>
  <summary>Old changelog entries</summary>

### v1.0.6 - (<small><i>The Jotunn update</i></small>)
* Updated Jotunn
* Updated FirstPersonMode
* Updated VikingsDoSwim
* Updated DethPinRemoval
* Updated AdvancedTerrainModifiers
* Updated WardIsLove

##### *Getting error <code>"ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: $item_wolf_meat_cooked"</code> but it can be ignored for now since it doesn't affekt the gameplay in any way. Had this since the start and pretty sure which mod it is, and in that case it's a stupid misstake from the mod devs side.*
---
### v1.0.4 - (<small><i>The neverending update</i></small>)
*Of course one or two mods just have to get updates right when I post the update!*
* Updated RtDBiomes and RtDMonsters to latest releases (frekkin like minutes ago).
* Fixed the description... Maybe...
---
### v1.0.3 - (<small><i>The "oops" fix</i></small>)
* Fixed a small setting I missed. Sorry. 
---
### v1.0.2 - (<small><i>The fix</i></small>)
* Updated a bunch of mods (well, every mod that had an update).
* Removed BowsBeforeHoes because it stopped working making arrows do no damage.
* Removed StatsLogger because Almanac feels like enough.
* Removed StartUpQuicker because it broke "something".
* Removed Leach because it's really badly made. Can basically make any creatrure stuck.
* CONFIG! Actually made some configuration changes. Amazing! :P
* SERVER! Fixed the server. New world. Working and all. Just click the Fast Link at the menu to login without needing any password. No whitelist but it demands a new character since the character is saved serverside. 
---
### v1.0.1 - (<small><i>Mods Update</i></small>)
- Uppdated RtDMonsters and WackyEpicMMOSystem to latest versions. Yeah, that's it basically. Sorry. ;)
---
### v1.0.0 - (<small><i>The release</i></small>)
- This is the first released version. Nothing in the configs have been tuned. Some might be to rewarding, some to hard. All this fixed in later versions but it will take time since this is made on the side of my "real" modpack for my whitelisted "friends only" server.
