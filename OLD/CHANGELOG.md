There is quite a bit of smaller mods not having been updated that have a bunch of bugs.  
Trying to fix them  as I find them and if you find a bug, please let me know on github.

Right now a bunch of these are removed.  
Some I found substitutes for but a lot I will fix something similar in the future.

Right now the focus is to get some stability to the modpack.

<b>EXTRA INFO</b>

<b>The next couple of days:</b>  
The modpack is updated to work with Ashland but isn't fully tested at the moment.  
As of writing this I'm just going to upload it and then turn off my computer and  
pack everything up and tomorrow morning I'm moving to a new apartment. 

*OBS! I would advice anyone that already have this modpack to remove the folder with
the mods before updating to this one. Othervise some mods might still be there breaking
the modpack. If you don't want your skills and styff be reseted, don't remove the profile  
but only the mods.*

My internet ism't going to be installed in my new apartment until monday (earliest)  
so the server is going to be down for a couple of days. The server isn't updated to  
the latest version atm, I'm waiting with it until I've moved and had time to test  
the modpack a bit more since it's quite a lot on it that I would like to keep. :P

<b>Configs:</b>
I've gone through the configs some more and changed a bit in some of them.  
Most things shouldn't be noticable but I've done a lot of changes in how the world  
load in stuff onto the map.  
There should be no more spawned traps on the map and all the extra grass, mushrooms  
and other "clutter" that's been added by different mods should be gone. I hated these  
so for me personally it's better this way. They were more in the way than bringing anything  
nice to the maps and the way modded clutter didn't fade in/out but just showed up/dissapeared  
instantly looked awful, specially in biomes like The Plains.

I've also made the extra trees be spawned in less than before. 

All these changes to clutter and trees should make the maps better. Before this you could  
hardly move without getting stuck on something and at the start you could barely build a  
basic camp because all these mushrooms and trees needed a better axe to remove.

<b>FIXES</b><p>
Been goin through the whole modpack during two days now trying to find what made the chat crash. Guess what... Nothing!<br>After spending forever checking the configs and then spending even longer adding each mod one at a time to find out what could have broken the chat... It all works!? Like... No reason at all! I haven't changed a thing and it just works. So now I'm pissed!<br>
Oh well...

<b>SERVER</b>
* Changed the player cap on the server to 20 people. Will probably change it to 50 or something in the future. Just not sure it works :p
* Changed the map to 2x the size in diameter which in reality make the map four times bigger. This is to see if it works ok and to actually make it not to crowded if there would be more players since, as mentioned above, the cap on server is set on 20 atm. 
* Chatter was added last update which make the chat better for players to actually use (as long as the chat continues to work).

|Release v1.2.5 |(<small><i>The exhausting update</i></small>)|
<b>ADDED</b>
* MaxPlayerCount v1.2.2
* Expand_World_Size v1.15.0

<b>RE-ADDED</b>

* TargetPortal updated to v1.1.18

* PlanBuild will to v0.15.0

<b>FIXES</b>
* Finally found the frekkin skull traps spawning config. Fixed! No more of those ruin a world (but you can still build and break your own). It wasn't just one mod behind it but a really bad cooperation between RtDBiomes and Expand_World_Data.
* Fixed some settings in ShutUp to only show errors now. 
* Lessened the clutter and trees from different mods. Should be able to actually move around now. :P

---

|Release v1.2.3 |(<small><i>The return, part 1</i></small>)|

<b>REMOVED (until updated/fixed)</b>
* CreatureAndLootControl
* Monstrum
* MonstrumAshlands
* MonstrumDeepNorth

<b>SERVER & MODPACK</b>
* It seems like the update changed quite much. It changed monsters/animals behaviors a bit, it switched out the engine for a newer version and a lot more. This sadly made some mods crash. The ones that broke the game have been removed. There is still some errors in the logfiles but atleast it seem to work now.
* The server have had the mods removed as well and been tested. Some small error in a cfg-file can make it fail to let you connect the first time, but second time you should be fine.
* Both modpack and server will have mods added again when they've been updated. :)

##### *Getting error <code>"ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: $item_wolf_meat_cooked"</code> but it can be ignored for now since it doesn't affekt the gameplay in any way. Had this since the start and pretty sure which mod it is, and in that case it's a stupid misstake from the mod devs side.*
---
|Release v1.0.4|(<small><i>The neverending update</i></small>)|

* Updated a bunch of mods (well, every mod that had an update).
* Removed BowsBeforeHoes because it stopped working making arrows do no damage.
* Removed StatsLogger because Almanac feels like enough.
* Removed StartUpQuicker because it broke "something".
* Removed Leach because it's really badly made. Can basically make any creatrure stuck.
* CONFIG! Actually made some configuration changes. Amazing! :P
* SERVER! Fixed the server. New world. Working and all. Just click the Fast Link at the menu to login without needing any password. No whitelist but it demands a new character since the character is saved serverside.

|Release v1.0.1|(<small><i>Mods Update</i></small>)|
- Uppdated RtDMonsters and WackyEpicMMOSystem to latest versions. Yeah, that's it basically. Sorry. ;)

|Release v1.0.0|(<small><i>The release</i></small>)|
- This is the first released version. Nothing in the configs have been tuned. Some might be to rewarding, some to hard. All this fixed in later versions but it will take time since this is made on the side of my "real" modpack for my whitelisted "friends only" server.
