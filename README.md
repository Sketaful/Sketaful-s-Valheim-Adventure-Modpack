# Sketaful's Valheim Adventure Modpack
This is my place for the configs so I can change them with ease from anywhere. Since it's quite a lot to configure it helps a lot and I need all the help I can get. ;P

This is also a perfect place to put this because it automatically gives me access to an Issues Tracker. So if anyone using this modpack experience anything they need changed, fixed or whatever. Use the "Issues" tab and post an issue so I can take a look at it.

Cheers
