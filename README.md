# Sketaful-s-Valheim-Adventure-Modpack
An easy place to read through the configs and for me to change them as I like in my own time. Anyone have any views on changes to the config, just let me know and I'll look into if I feel it should be changed. Mainly I have this place for the issue tracker so if anyone have any issues getting the modpack to run use the issue tracker.
