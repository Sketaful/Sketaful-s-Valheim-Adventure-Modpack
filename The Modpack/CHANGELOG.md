<b>V2.1.8

    REMOVED:  
    * Gizmo
      For some reason portals stop working when using Gizmo.  
      Strangest thing since this should have no effect on portals (it handle rotations).  
    
    ADDED:  
    * PerfectPlacement 1.2.2 by Azumatt
      Replaced Gizmo. Allows rotations around all axis, finer adjustments etc.  
      Not as straight forward as Gizmo but the only solution next to just skipping it all together.  
    
    CONFIGS:  
    * Moving building blocks, chests etc is changed from SHIFT to C.  
      So to move something placed wrong, instead of having to tear it down,  
      Hold the hamme, hold C and left-click on the object. This way you can move a chest with inventory intact.  
    * PerfectPlacement had really annoying keybindings. Most of which was used by other vanilla keybindings.  
      Now you rotate on different axis by holding SHIFT, CTRL or ALT and using scroll wheel.  
      You can enter "Advanced Building" by pressing F3 (you will see controls for that ingame to the left).

    * ClayBuildPieces v1.2.4
    * CookingAdditions v1.2.6

    CONFIG:
     Changed keybinds that had been reseted.
     P stores from inventory to chests again.

    INFO:
     I have one friend that tried logging in to the server after last update and his character was stuck,  
     his inventory was messed up, his view showed buttons for controllers and nothing worked.  
     He's the only one I know that experienced this problem and I can't replicate it. 
     PLEASE! If anyone else experience the same problems, joind my discord and upload your logfile
     so I can find a solution to this. It's really weird and as said, he's the only one, so far.

---

    REMOVED/QUICKFIX:
    * RichDiscordPresence
	  The mod worked perfectly but somehow it's not working with AzuAnti-Cheat.  
      It just refuses to be accepted. Joining server with this not in the list  
      of allowed mods doesn't work, which is fine, that's how it's supposed to be.
    
      But if added to the list of allowed mods, AzuAnti-Cheat starts complaining  
      about a mod not being allowd on the server and just randomly choose a mod  
      to complain about even though they all are on the allowed list.
    
    It's annoying but the only solution is to just not use RichDiscordPresence  
    since it's not essential to the game. But now I'm sad. ;(

    INFO:
    I'm working on a server for this, but first I need to see that it actually works. I mean, it works for me,
    but I need more people trying it out before I can start working on a server. 
    The good part is that most configs are done now in this modpack and should only need minor changes for a server.

<b>V1.4.1 (Beta-ish)

Updated for latest version of Valheim, finally.

Please report any problems in my discord.  
I am sure there will be a bunch of bugs and need helpful people reporting them to find them all. :)

!!!MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR OLD WORLD BEFORE RUNNING THIS!!!

README
    This is a quite late and big update.  
    Either remove the old configs before running this one or 
    preferably, do a clean install of this version.

    Life came between me and the modpack which left it in a void for a long time  
    and I still haven't gotten the time to go through the configs as I'd like.  
    Sorry for that. 

    CHANGES NEEDED:
    There will most probably be a bunch of things needed to be changed in the configs,  
    specially when it come to spawning and drops. This is because a couple of mods have  
    changed their prefabs which I need to change in the configs as well.
    Luckily (I guess we can call it) these are not that many as it could have been since  
    I haven't had time to make all the changes I planned. But some are going to need to be  
    done and I will as soon as possible.

    BUT NOW...
    Try it out and make sure it works. I have tried it but it take so much time to accidently  
    do "that" which breaks the whole pack so ever little info or help in finding bugs is good help.

    CONFIG CHANGES (Server)
    * Tombstones disapearing have been fixed, kinda. It's now set on a timer.
      Every time you die you have 30 days (real life time) to get your
      things back before the tombstone disappear. This to give you time but
      not forever because the world spawn would be filled with tombstones from 
      one-time logins dying a bunch of times and never coming back. 
      Every tombstone is locked so it can't be looted by other players so they
      need to be removed somehow. :)
    * Professions is having some overhaul. Atm it's only some nerf in sailing,
      nothing big. Max speed with boats at level 100 in sailinng i changed from
      50% increase to 30% increase. May have more nerfs and fixes in the future
      (changing it for each ship is the future plan since some mod-ships are to fast.)

<details>
  <summary>V1.3.41</summary>

    UPDATED:
    * WackysDatabase updated to v2.4.13

    CONFIG CHANGES:
	Fixed config for SleepSkip. I kinda missunderstood the config thinking
    that setting it to a minimum of 2 players would make it just be vanilla 
    sleeping when only one player was online. Instead it meant that if there
    was only one player online sleeping didn't work at all.
	
    New config means that when enough people sleeps a countdown of 15 sec start
    until everyone get to vote on sleeping or not no matter if they're in bed
    or not. This is only on the server.
    On the client it's a 3 sec countdown and then you sleep. No vote or anything.
    I figured noone that play this in singleplayer would like to have to wait
    15 second for a popup to show before they can sleep. ;)
	
    INFO:
    I'm still having a hard time getting the spawning changes to work.
	Seems like mobs I thought I managed to change the spawning on still
    spawn during days when set to only nights and so on. 
    Strange is that they spawn less, which means it actually affects the
    spawning so the settings still works kinda and that's even worse.
    Would have been better knowing I just screwed up the configs but now
    I'm not sure it's not just a prob with spawning behavior over all.

    I'm also just going to continue the screwed up versions since I already
    have it set now. 

    Config changes is going to be a lot easier than changing/updating mods
    so most changes during the week will be on the server and when I see
    that they work I'll implement them into the modpack. This way I don't
    have to do a modpack update each time I do a config change and have Some
    time trying them out since configs is serverside when on a server.

    REMOVED:
    * ShutUp v1.0.2 by Smoothbrain (temporary prob)
    * StartupAccelerator v1.0.3 by Smoothbrain (temporary prob)

IMPORTANT!

    Since StartupAccelerator and ShutUp put themselves as "patchers"  
    you need to either do a clean install of this modpack or manually  
    remove the folder for them in BepInEx\Patchers\ of your modfolder.  
    
    NEXT UPDATE:  
    In the next update I will switch from ComfyQuickSlots to  
    AzuExtendedPlayerInventory because it's just plain better and more  
    supported by the other mods in this modpack.  
    
    To not lose your things in the extra slots on your character,  
    remove everything from your character, EVERYTHING, and put in a chest  
    before updating the modpack!

    REMOVED:
    * PlanBuild
    * RockTheBoat

    ADDED:
    * RtDAdditions  

    The problem this modpack got when mods changed, mods got split up  
    and other have driven me half-insane.  
      
    I'm not saying it's solved yet, but I found some of the mods that  
    didn't work well with others. So errors in log is down by 90%.  
      
    I will have to look into why Deer is getting worked up when players  
    get neer, but not scared enough to run away like they should.

    * RtDMonstrum updated to v0.0.4


    Remind me to never ever update a mod that's been rewritten, 
    split up or had any other major change.
    
    Hopefully these updates to the RtD mods will let players
    join the server again. 
    (Console error was "znet" and the updates says "Fixed double znet")

    SERVER!

    Server runs new world now. Regular size.
	
    INFO  
    Solaredis split his mods into smaller ones which ruined a lot for me since I only 
    watched what updates he released through the modlauncher and only installed mods 
    show up there.  
  
    So here's an update again with the missing parts of his mods. Enjoy.

    SERVER!
    The server is reseted.  
    So for those that want a server to just have fun on trying  
    out this modpack on, then now's the time.  
    
    The server is at its easiest the first 50 days.  
    After that it get a bit harder over time.

EXTRA INFO

    The next couple of days:  
    The modpack is updated to work with Ashland but isn't fully tested at the moment.  
    As of writing this I'm just going to upload it and then turn off my computer and  
    pack everything up and tomorrow morning I'm moving to a new apartment. 

    *OBS! I would advice anyone that already have this modpack to remove the folder with
    the mods before updating to this one. Othervise some mods might still be there breaking
    the modpack. If you don't want your skills and styff be reseted, don't remove the profile  
    but only the mods.*

    My internet ism't going to be installed in my new apartment until monday (earliest)  
    so the server is going to be down for a couple of days. The server isn't updated to  
    the latest version atm, I'm waiting with it until I've moved and had time to test  
    the modpack a bit more since it's quite a lot on it that I would like to keep. :P

    Configs:
    I've gone through the configs some more and changed a bit in some of them.  
    Most things shouldn't be noticable but I've done a lot of changes in how the world  
    load in stuff onto the map.  
    There should be no more spawned traps on the map and all the extra grass, mushrooms  
    and other "clutter" that's been added by different mods should be gone. I hated these  
    so for me personally it's better this way. They were more in the way than bringing anything  
    nice to the maps and the way modded clutter didn't fade in/out but just showed up/dissapeared  
    instantly looked awful, specially in biomes like The Plains.

    I've also made the extra trees be spawned in less than before. 

    All these changes to clutter and trees should make the maps better. Before this you could  
    hardly move without getting stuck on something and at the start you could barely build a  
    basic camp because all these mushrooms and trees needed a better axe to remove.

    FIXES:
    Been goin through the whole modpack during two days now trying to find what made the chat crash. 
    Guess what... Nothing!

    After spending forever checking the configs and then spending even longer adding each mod one at a 
    time to find out what could have broken the chat... It all works!? Like... No reason at all! 
    I haven't changed a thing and it just works. So now I'm pissed!
    Oh well...

SERVER
    * Changed the player cap on the server to 20 people. Will probably change it to 50 or something in the future. 
      Just not sure it works :p
    * Changed the map to 2x the size in diameter which in reality make the map four times bigger. 
      This is to see if it works ok and to actually make it not to crowded if there would be more players
      since, as mentioned above, the cap on server is set on 20 atm. 
    * Chatter was added last update which make the chat better for players to actually use (as long as the chat continues to work).

FIXES
    * Finally found the frekkin skull traps spawning config. Fixed! No more of those ruin a world 
      (but you can still build and break your own). 
      It wasn't just one mod behind it but a really bad cooperation between RtDBiomes and Expand_World_Data.
    * Fixed some settings in ShutUp to only show errors now. 
    * Lessened the clutter and trees from different mods. Should be able to actually move around now. :P

    SERVER & MODPACK  
    * It seems like the update changed quite much. It changed monsters/animals behaviors a bit, it switched out the engine 
      for a newer version and a lot more. This sadly made some mods crash. The ones that broke the game have been removed. 
      There is still some errors in the logfiles but atleast it seem to work now.
    * The server have had the mods removed as well and been tested. Some small error in a cfg-file can make it fail to 
      let you connect the first time, but second time you should be fine.
    * Both modpack and server will have mods added again when they've been updated. :)

    SERVER
    * Since the Expand world mods didn't seem to be removed as they should have the server blocked the modpack.
      This should now be fixed. 

    * Server is running a new world (noone actually playing on it anyway and I plan to start :P).

  <summary>V1.0.6</summary>

    UPDATED:
    * Updated Jotunn
    * Updated FirstPersonMode
    * Updated VikingsDoSwim
    * Updated DethPinRemoval
    * Updated AdvancedTerrainModifiers
    * Updated WardIsLove

    Getting error <code>"ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: $item_wolf_meat_cooked"
    but it can be ignored for now since it doesn't affekt the gameplay in any way. Had this since the start and 
    pretty sure which mod it is, and in that case it's a stupid misstake from the mod devs side.

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.5</summary>

    Of course one or two mods just have to get updates right when I post the update!

    * Updated RtDBiomes and RtDMonsters to latest releases (frekkin like minutes ago).
    * Fixed the description... Maybe...
	
</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.4</summary>

    * Fixed a small setting I missed. Sorry. 
	
</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.2</summary>

    UPDATED:
    * Updated a bunch of mods (well, every mod that had an update).
    * Removed BowsBeforeHoes because it stopped working making arrows do no damage.
    * Removed StatsLogger because Almanac feels like enough.
    * Removed StartUpQuicker because it broke "something".
    * Removed Leach because it's really badly made. Can basically make any creatrure stuck.
    * CONFIG! Actually made some configuration changes. Amazing! :P
    * SERVER! Fixed the server. New world. Working and all. Just click the Fast Link at the menu to login 
      without needing any password. No whitelist but it demands a new character since the character is saved serverside.

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.1</summary>
  
    UPDATED:
    * Uppdated RtDMonsters and WackyEpicMMOSystem to latest versions. Yeah, that's it basically. Sorry. ;)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>V1.0.0</summary>

    This is the first released version. Nothing in the configs have been tuned. Some might be to rewarding,  
    some to hard. All this fixed in later versions but it will take time since this is made on the side of  
    my "real" modpack for my whitelisted "friends only" server.
