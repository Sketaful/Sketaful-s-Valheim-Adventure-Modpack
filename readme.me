# Sketaful's Adventure Pack  
<small>A modpack for Valheim aimed at being challanging and helpful at the same time (yes, it's impossible, I know)</small>

---

This readme is here as a placeholder for the time being while I try to sort things up in my mind and on github on how I want to do this. First thought I'd just have the configs for the modpack here to change and just keep as-is, but since then I've decided it will be split up some.  
The plan so far is to separate the configs between ```client only```,```server only``` and for ```both```, since some mods are only used on servers, some on clients and so on. ;)
