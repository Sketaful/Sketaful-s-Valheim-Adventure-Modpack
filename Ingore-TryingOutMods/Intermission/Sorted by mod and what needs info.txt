LicensePlate v1.3.0 by ComfyMods
If you look at the rudder of your ship and press SHIFT+E you can name it so everyone can see it's your ship.

MorePins
The map have been enhanced with many more different pins.\nThe standard pins are still there as well but coloured.

CustomRaids
The raids you can get on your base is not always the ones you've seen before. *hint* *hint*

DualWield
You can now dual wield and not only weapons but also tools.\nTry holding two axes and do a special attack (middle mouse) and see how quickly you can chop down a tree.

InstantMonsterLootDrop
It's annoying to hit a creature and see it glide down a hillside before despawning so you can loot it.\nWell, fear not! All creatures despawn and now drop their loot the instant they're killed!

Item_Stand_All_Items
The item stands can hold next to every item in the game now so go nuts decorating with whatever you can come up with.

Groups/Guilds/Friends
If you play on a server with many players you can add friends, make a guild and make a group. Whichever suits you best.]\nGuilds and Friends are added through the UI when pressing TAB ingame, Groups need an /invite [playername] in chat.

Heightmap_Unlimited_Remake
You can lower or raise the ground by 50 meters instead of the regular 8 meters.

TargetPortal
Portals do not need to be connected anymore. When using one portal a map will show up with all other portals on it. Just click the portal you need to go to.\n
You can make your portals show up on the map for everyone, only for yourself or for your guild/group/friends.

Expand_World_Size
The world is not locked to one size any more. Make the world 2x, 4x or 16 larger. Just remember to add the extra amount of places to find or it will feel empty.

PlantEverything
You can plant a lot more things now, some added and some just vanilla plants that didn't allow it before. Planting and harvesting have been made easier as well.

WieldEquipment
Except for the hoe, all weapons and tools can be held and used while in water. Never have to re-equip again just because a wave took you by surprice.

Recycle
So you made some things and now you realize you don't need them? You can now recycle your things at the crafting table used to make them to get some material back.

BuildableBossStone
When you kill a boss and get the trophy you can choose to put it up at spawn or build your own boss stone wherever you like and hang the head there.

Itemhopper
You can make item hoppers and connect to furnaces and more to be able to add more things at a time to be used.\n
Warning! If you leave the area so it get unloaded things might fall out and have to be picked up.
