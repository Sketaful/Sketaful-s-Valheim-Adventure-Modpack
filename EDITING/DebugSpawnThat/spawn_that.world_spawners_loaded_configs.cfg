# This file was auto-generated by Spawn That 1.2.14 at 2024-08-17 00:26:43Z, with Valheim '0.218.19'.
# The entries listed here were generated from the internally loaded world spawner configurations.
# This is intended to reveal the state of Spawn That, after loading configs from all sources, and before applying them to in-game spawners.
# This file is not scanned by Spawn That, and any changes done will therefore have no effect. Copy sections into a world spawner config in the configs folder, if you want to change things.
# Be aware, for entries added by mods using the Spawn That API, it might not be showing the full truth but an approximation, since the API can do a lot more than the config file allows.
